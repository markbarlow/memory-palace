2.30 am on a school night. It’s been a while. 

The taxi driver has the passenger side window open a crack, despite the winter weather.  I’d like him to close it for me, but I prefer he keeps it open for him. 

It’s been years since I came this way.  It was once a regular route North, shooting up from Islington. 

Up past Clissolds, the house for Simon Community volunteers, where N lived when we first met. It was fun - for a while - but it was never meant to be. There was a pub there called The Albion. I wrote an instrumental about it once, which later turned into a song. Not a particularly good one, so we never recorded it.

On to Turnpike Lane, where that relationship faltered and ended. Where I first looked for a flat share, before joining Chris in Archway. 

I mourn the person and I mourn the youth. I think I know where the balance lies. 

I used to drink more in both frequency and volume. Nowadays it’s worth saving for the nights that make it worth the subsequent pain. Most nights do not. This one I think does - at least that’s my hope before the morning comes.
