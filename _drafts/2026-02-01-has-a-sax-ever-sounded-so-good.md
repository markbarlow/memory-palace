I'm leaving aside jazz here.

The tone at the start perfectly communicates the gut-wrenching pain, longing, anger and defiance of the start the story.

By the outro the same line is played smoothly and fades into the background. It's mournful, melancholy - and defeated. 

The album *A Pagan Place* was introduced to me by J in my first year at university, in his room four doors down from mine. *This is the Sea* was the more well known album, its single *The Whole of the Moon* omnipresent for a while, but this one caps it.
