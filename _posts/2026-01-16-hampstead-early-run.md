![The model boating pond](/memory-palace/assets/images/posts/blog/2026/hampstead-model-boating-pond.jpg)

The sun coming up over the model boating pond, Hampstead Heath, on an early morning run into work.

Until now I had no idea that was the name of the pond. I've not seen a single model boat on it. It's normally deserted when I go past, or at most there may be someone walking by or fishing.
